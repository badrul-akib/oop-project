    <div class="right">
        <p>The present world is depends on digitalization. Each and every process is going through digital process. Education system is also including on them. Many updated technologies are adding with education system in recent times. Now a days also exam system are being handled through digital system. By keeping this on mind,  I have tried to do something digitally. That is online assesment system.Online assesment can bring a revolutionary change in exam system. Students can attend exam by staying in home. So it will be more easy and flexible for students. In this project here I have included some features which would be very much helpful for teachers and students also. It is a moderate level approach which can be broader in future. I just have tried little and hoping that i can work huge a lot on it in future.

        <p> I have used Swing to design ta interface of this project. The text box,  the butyon, scroll bar and remote button were designed through java swing. I have implemented the java code on swing interface. Also I have used Java AWT for designing also. Java AWT helps me to imolement the function of this project. CSS were used to design the external design of this project. For UI/UX,  I have used Adobe XD. Adobe XD is a software which can help you to define the interface of a project. All those were finalize on VS Code. By using all those features I have tried my best to implement the project</p>

        <p>We are familiar with traditional offline assessment. But when it comes to online, 
            most students faces difficulties. Such as<br><br>

            2. How the marks will be distributed.<br>
            3. If they will be user-friendly.<br>
            4.  How to submit papers online.<br>
